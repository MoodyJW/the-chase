Everything!

General idea: small game where user chases a dot around the screen

Components needed:

- main: holds everything
- board: the play area, likely subscribing to mouse/click/tap events and setting up communication between the dot and the mouse/tap
- dot: the thing palyer chases, will need to react to mouse entering/clicking and touch

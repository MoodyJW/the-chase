# the-chase

This is (or will be) a basic game where the player chases dots around trying to click/tap them before a timer ends. Each time a dot is touched, the timer resets. Another dot is added every five seconds. The game ends when any dot timer reaches 0.

Mainly writing this to play around with RxJS.
